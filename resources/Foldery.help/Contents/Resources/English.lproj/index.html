		<p>	<h1>Foldery</h1>
			Foldery is a small utility which lets you tint your folders.
		</p>

		<p>	<h1>System Requeriments</h1>
			Mac computer with 32 or 64 bit Intel processor and Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard o higher.
		</p>

		<p>	<h1>Limitations in Snow Leopard</h1>
			The icon files of OS X contain multiple images of various sizes. Foldery generates icons using a format newer than the one used in Snow Leopard, consequently this version of OS X is only able to interpret images 512x512 and 256x256 pixels they contain. This is not a real problem, the icons look great but when they are visualized in a small size in the Finder, appearance will not be exactly like the icons of normal folders.

		<p>	<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>

			<h2>Why It appears that Folderay can not tint folders sometimes?</h2>
			<div>It is not Foldery's fault, blame Finder. Sometimes, depending on some factors, like for example the content of the folder, it appears that Finder is not notified about the icon change for a while. If you open the folder you can see that the icon at the top of the Finder's window has changed. You can see that the icon has changed in the folder's information window too.</div>

			<h2>What happens if I tint a folder which has a custom icon already?</h2>
			<div>The custom icon of the folder will be replaced by the new one assigned by Foldery. You will not be able to restore the former. This happens because before assigning an icon to a folder, Foldery removes any custom icon. If not done, sometimes the system doesn't assign the new icon if the folder has a custom one (Maybe a bug in OS X).</div>

			<h2>What happens if I drag folders with custom icons to Foldery in restore mode?</h2>
			<div>All custom icons will be removed.</div>
